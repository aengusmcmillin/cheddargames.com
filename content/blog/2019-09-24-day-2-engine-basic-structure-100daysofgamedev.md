description: Basic Gouda Engine Structure
---
Today I got a bit of coding done. I have implemented most of these components before, but I'm taking advantage of this fresh start to rearchitect things a little bit, and contribute things in a more incremental way to make it easier to present it all in future posts.

Nothing special to show off, but I have code on my [Github](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/Gouda) with basic foundations of the engine refresh. 

Also spent some more time tweaking things on the site and, of course, [writing](https://cheddargames.com/blog/2019-09-24-gouda-engine-devlog-intro-and-basic-game-loop) on this blog.
