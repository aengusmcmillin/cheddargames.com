description: Bit of planning
---
Only had about 40 minutes this morning before work, and had to head off to D&D soon after work, so didn't get too much done today, basically just wrote my game plan blog post. I also did some basic pixel art last night since my last update, so now I have at least some WIP assets to use in early versions for a player, campfire, tower, and tiles.
